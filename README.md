# setup
This code was tested on the python 3.
# Dataset
Using the really sample captcha dataset. Dataset is easily available at the website "htttp://wordpress.org". this dataset has 800,000+ active installations.
Source code to the wordpress login is already available. Image are in png format 
# captcha decoding
Decoding the captcha code using CNN with two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers.

•	Designed a Deep Learning CNN architecture network for computer vision that breaks the text-based CAPTCHA’s by using TensorFlow an open-source library for machine learning.

•	Used pooling layers to make the model more dynamic and robust. 

•	The designed and developed model trains with 20% of total feasible data and cracks the current text-based captcha’s with a high accuracy rate of 97.8%, altering the security concerns to online transactions.
